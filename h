Hi, it's me Tripple.

I got banned on the Sound Space server for a good reason. I fucked up big time. I had too many second chances.

I had joked about getting an IP Adress, when the person himself told me his location. I guess you can call me a bully because I wanted to see a reaction out of the server. I have no idea how to nab an IP or anything

I had said the n word a couple times. Once in a different language, and another flat out.

I fucked up big time by joking about an IP Adress. I shouldn't have done that and I can not make up for my mistake, as it is too severe to make up.

There was too many times where I was given a second chance. I should have been banned weeks ago, but the Sound Space community was too kind and giving.

This is my final goodbye from the sound space community. I hope you all have a good day, and farewell everyone. It was fun while it lasted, but now fun can only be found in heaven. And that's where I'm going.

Goodbye everyone.

Sincerely, Tripple.
